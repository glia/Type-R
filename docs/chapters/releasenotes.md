# Release Notes

## 2.1.0

This release adds long-awaited HTTP REST endpoint.

- IO endpoints moved outside of the man sources tree. Creation of the custom endpoints is easier than ever.
- Added HTTP REST endpoint `restfulIO` with relative urls support (https://volicon.github.io/Type-R/#endpoint-restfulio-url-options-).
- Added proxyIO endpoint for creating endpoints from records on the server side (https://volicon.github.io/Type-R/#endpoint-proxyio-recordctor-).

## 2.0.0

This release brings new features which fixes problems with component's inheritance in React bindings and implements long-awaited generic IO implementation based on ES6 promises.

There shouldn't be breaking changes _unless_ you're using custom logger or React bindings (formerly known as React-MVx, with a name changed to React-R in new release).

### Generic IO support

New [IOEndpoint]() concept is introduced, making it easy to create IO abstractions. To enable `Record`Â and `Collection` IO API, you need to assign IO endpoint in the class definition.

Endpoint is the class defining CRUD and list operations on JSON data, as well as the methods to subscribe for the data changes. There are two endpoints included with 2.0 release, `memoryIO` which is suitable for mock testing and `localStorageIO` which could be used in demos and prototypes. They can be used as a references as starting points to define your own IO endpoints.

```javascript
@define class User extends Record {
    static endpoint = memoryIO();
    static attributes = {
        name : String,
        ...
    }
}
```

There are three Record IO methods (`save()`, `fetch()`, and `destroy()`) and two collection IO method (`fetch()` and `liveUpdates()`) ). All IO methods returns ES6 promises, so you either must have the runtime supporting ES6 or use the ES6 promise polyfill. The promises are modified to be _abortable_ (all of them have `abort()` method).

```javascript
const user = new User({ name : 'John' });
user.save().then( () => {
    console.log( `new user is added ${ user.id }` )
});
```

There's the special `attributesIO()` endpoint to fetch all of attributes independently and return the combined promise. This is the recommended way of fetching the data required by SPA page.

```javascript
@define class PageStore extends Store {
    static endpoint = attributesIO();
    static attributes = {
        users : User.Collection,
        roles : UserRole.Collection,
        ...
    }
}

const store = new PageStore();
store.fetch().then( () =>{
    // render your page
});
```

It's possible to define or override the defined endpoint for the nested model or collection using `has.endpoint` type-R attribute annotation.

```javascript
@define class PageStore extends Store {
    static endpoint = attributesIO();
    static attributes = {
        users : User.Collection.has.endpoint( restful( '/api/users' ) ),
        roles : UserRole.Collection.has.endpoint( restful( '/api/userroles' ) ),
        ...
    }
}
```

Please note, that `restful` endpoint is not included with 2.0 release but is planned for the future 2.x releases.

### New mixins engine

Type-R metaprogramming system built on powerful mixins composition with configurable member merge rules. In 2.0 release, mixins engine was rewritten to properly apply merge rules on inheritance. This feature is heavily used in Type-R React's bindings and is crucial to prevent errors when extending the `React.Component` subclasses.

An example illustrating the principle:

```javascript
@define
// Define the class with 
@mixinRules({
    componentWillMount : mixinRules.classLast,
    componentWillUnmount : mixinRules.classFirst
})
class Component {
    componentWillMount(){
        console.log( 1 );
    }
    
    componentWillUnmount(){
        console.log( 3 );
    }
}

@define
@mixins({
    componentWillMount(){
        console.log( 2 );
    },
    
    componentWillUnmount(){
        console.log( 2 );
    }
})
class MyBaseComponent extends Component {
    componentWillMount(){
        console.log( 3 );
    }
    
    componentWillUnmount(){
        console.log( 1 );
    }
}
```

In this example, all of the methods defined in the mixin, base class, and subclass will be called in the order specified in the `console.log`.

### Other changes

- Update pipeline was rewritten to improve record's initialization speed (collection's fetch speed is improved by 30%).
- Fixed bug which case dynamic type checks to be disabled in records constructors.
- New implementation of the `Collection.subsetOf` which both fixes some edge case bugs and is more efficient.
- New logger handling NODE_ENV variable setting.
